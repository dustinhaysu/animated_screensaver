    <strong>Big Balls-Song by AC/DC::</strong>
    
        Well I'm upper-upper class high society
        God's gift to ballroom notoriety
        And I always fill my ballroom
        The event is never small
        The social pages say I've got
        The biggest balls of all
        I've got big balls
        I've got big balls
        They're such big balls
        And they're dirty big balls
        And he's got big balls
        And she's got big balls
        (But we've got the biggest balls of them all)
        And my balls are always bouncing
        My ballroom always full
        And everybody comes and comes again
        If your name is on the guest list
        No one can take you higher
        Everybody says I've got
        Great balls of fire
        I've got big balls
        Oh, I've got big balls
        And they're such big balls
        Dirty big balls
        And he's got big balls
        And she's got big balls
        (But we've got the biggest balls of them all)
        Some balls are held for charity
        And some for fancy dress
        But when they're held for pleasure
        They're the balls that I like best
        My balls are always bouncing
        To the left and to the right
        It's my belief that my big balls
        Should be held every night (oh)
        We've got big balls
        We've got big balls
        We've got big balls
        Dirty big balls
        He's got big balls
        She's got big balls
        (But we've got the biggest balls of them all)
        And I'm just itching to tell you about them (we've got big balls)
        (We've got big balls) Oh, we had such wonderful fun (we've got big balls)
        Seafood cocktail, crabs (we've got big balls)
        Crayfish (but we've got the biggest balls of them all)</h2>
